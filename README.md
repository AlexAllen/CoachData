# CoachData

This script produces a spreadsheet with a summary of information about paddlesport coaches for clubs. It takes info from a range of spreadsheet reports that British Canoeing makes available to clubs, and compiles them into a single spreadsheet for ease of use.

The spreadsheet produced has space for clubs to add in any site specific training and assessment that their coaches have done, and lets them assign remits for each of the coaches. It has a sheet for each of the coaches with detailed information in it, and also produces a few summary sheets for ease of use. 

The summary sheets it currently produces are:
- Currency
    - This is based off the information BC provides, apart from the DBS column which is something that must be manually input to each coach's page
- Remits
    - This is based off the remits manually put input to each coach's page, and lists the craft each coach is allowed to operate from when working with each combination of craft and environment
- Providerships
    - This picks out a few key providerships (based on what my club has) and lists all coaches who can provide them.

The reports it uses from British Canoeing are to generate this data are:
- My Club Members with Coach Validation
- Safety Report
- First Aid Training
- Safeguarding Report
- All Member Credentials
